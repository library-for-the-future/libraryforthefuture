			<h1>library/for/the/future</h1>
			<p>
				What does a radical feminist library look like today?
				Which books are feminists turning to for thought-partnership?
				How might a collection of texts help us imagine new feminist futures?
			</p>
			<p>
				<em>library/for/the/future</em> is a network of physical and	digital spaces designed to support feminist thoughtpartnershipand resource-sharing. We collaborate with	artists to generate feminist library collections around a central question or theme.
			</p>
			<p>
				Each collection gathers books that have informed readers’ relationships to feminism. The content, location, and 	physical form of every library collection is unique; in	this sense, it is a resource for the future and a record of a particular kind of thinking at a particular time and place. library/for/the/future takes its shape from the dialogue between these collections.

				We are currently inviting contributions to<br>
				feminist/by/design — a collection of books	that have shaped designers’ relationships to feminism. Which feminist books and resources 	are on the shelves of your studio?
			</p>

			<p>
				Your response will be catalogued and archived here, alongside
				those of other designers.
